## üîç How to use update-pre-commit-action?

### Use Case 1Ô∏è‚É£ - example workflow
```
name: update-pre-commit-action

on:
  # on schedule: e.g. every day at 5:30 pm UTC
  schedule:
    - cron: '30 17 * * *'

  # on demand
  workflow_dispatch:

permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: read

jobs:
  update-pre-commit:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: write
      pull-requests: write

    steps:
    - name: Run update-pre-commit
      id: update-pre-commit
      env:
        GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      uses: tagdots/update-pre-commit-action@1.0.0
      with:
        file: .pre-commit-config.yaml
        dry-run: false
        open-pr: true
```

<br>

### Use Case 1Ô∏è‚É£ - summary descriptions
The above GitHub action workflow will:

* review the configuration file on a scheduled interval (`- cron: '30 17 * * *'`)
* need write permissions to contents and pull-requests (`contents: write` and `pull-requests: write`)
* update the configuration file - `.pre-commit-config.yaml` (`dry-run: false`)
* open a pull request when updates become available (`open-pr: true`)

  # on schedule: e.g. every day at 5:30 pm UTC
  schedule:
    - cron: '30 17 * * *'

  # on demand
  workflow_dispatch:

permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: read

jobs:
  update-pre-commit:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Run update-pre-commit
      id: update-pre-commit
      env:
        GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      uses: tagdots/update-pre-commit-action@1.0.0
      with:
        file: .pre-commit-config.yaml
        dry-run: false
        open-pr: false
```

<br>

### Use Case 2Ô∏è‚É£ - summary descriptions
The above GitHub action workflow will:

* review the configuration file on a scheduled interval (`- cron: '30 17 * * *'`)
* update the configuration file - `.pre-commit-config.yaml` (`dry-run: false`)
* _NOT_ open a pull request when updates become available (`open-pr: false`)

You will review the workflow results, cherry-pick updates, and open a pull-request yourself.
